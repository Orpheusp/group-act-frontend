# Group Act

Project Group Act was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), which uses **npm** to manage dependencies, **Prettier** to format code, **ESLint** to ensure coding standards, and **webpack** to bundle files for deployment

The app is built using React + javascript + CSS modules, with UI tests written with storybook, and unit tests written with Jest.
